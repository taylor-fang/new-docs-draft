# What are locales?

General Translation uses locale codes to identify and translate between languages, scripts, and regions.

## What are locale codes?

A locale is **a language or dialect**. Locale codes are a standardized way of referring to locales.

For example, `en-US` is a locale code which refers to the English language as spoken in the United States of America.

Locales can be general or specific:

- `zh` is Chinese
- `zh-Hant` is Chinese, written with traditional characters
- `zh-Hant-HK` is Chinese, written with traditional characters, as spoken in Hong Kong

Locale codes tell General Translation what language a source file is written in, what language to translate into, and how to format locale-aware values like dates, numbers, and currency.

## How locale codes work

General Translation uses the **[BCP 47 Language Tag](https://www.techonthenet.com/js/language_tags.php)** standard to define locale codes. This Internet Best Current Practices (BCP) standard for languages defines a uniform way to specify both spoken and written languages. 

A locale code can include several subtags separated by the `-` character:

- **Language code** (required): Represents the primary language, such as `en` for English or `es` for Spanish. Language codes follow **[ISO-639](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes)**.
- **Script code** (optional): Indicates the writing system, such as `Latn` for the Latin alphabet. Script codes follow **[ISO-15924](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15924)**.
- **Region code** (optional): Specifies a country or region, such as `US` for the United States or `FR` for France. Region codes follow **[ISO-3166](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2)**.

For example, `zh-Hant-HK` is broken down into:

- `zh` for Chinese
- `Hant` for Traditional Chinese characters
- `HK` for Hong Kong

Together, `zh-Hant-HK` means "Chinese, written in Traditional Chinese characters, as spoken in Hong Kong."

### Equivalent locale tags

Some locale tags are functionally equivalent for translation.

For example, `fr` means French, which is equivalent to:

- `fr-FR`, which means French as used in France.
- `fr-FR-Latn` which means French as used in France, written with the Latin alphabet.

The General Translation libraries and platform usually do not distinguish between equivalent codes, since the translation output would be the same.

## General Translation supported locales

The `generaltranslation` library supports any validly constructed locale tag, including private-use codes with no widely recognized meaning. 

However, the General Translation platform only translates locales supported by GT. See an up-to-date, searchable list on the [Supported locales](/docs/platform/dashboard/reference/supported-locales) page.
