# Roles and permissions

Roles control what members can see and do across your Organization and Projects.

## Organization roles

When an Organization is created, four default roles are set up automatically:

| Role          | Description                                                                                                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Admin**     | Full access to all Organization and Project settings, members, billing, and translations. Can delete the Organization. |
| **Developer** | Technical access to Projects—API keys, GitHub integration, Locadex, and usage data. Cannot manage members or billing. |
| **Editor**    | Can read, edit, and review translations. No access to settings, members, or billing.                                  |
| **Member**    | Can view the Organization but has no specific permissions. Useful as a base role with additional per-user overrides.  |

## Enterprise roles

Enterprise accounts have an additional layer of roles for managing multiple Organizations. For details on Enterprise roles and permissions, [contact us](https://generaltranslation.com/en-US/enterprise/contact).

## Permissions reference

Permissions are grouped into categories. The table below shows which default roles have access to each permission.

## Permission inheritance

Permissions flow downward through the hierarchy:

**Enterprise → Organization → Project**

If a user has a permission at the Enterprise level, they automatically have it for all Organizations and Projects within that Enterprise. Similarly, Organization-level permissions apply to all Projects in that Organization.
