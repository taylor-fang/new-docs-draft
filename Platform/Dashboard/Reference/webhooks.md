# Webhooks

Webhooks send translation events to your backend as signed HTTP POST requests. Use them to trigger your own workflows when files or jobs change.

## Create a webhook

1. Go to **Organization Settings > Webhooks**.
2. Click **Create Webhook**.
3. Enter the endpoint URL where you want to receive events. The URL must use HTTPS.
4. Select the event types you want to subscribe to.
5. Click **Create**.

After creating the endpoint, open the webhook detail page and copy the signing secret. Use this secret to verify that incoming requests are from General Translation.

You can create up to **5 webhook endpoints** per Organization.

## Event types

Each endpoint can subscribe to one or more event types. You can update subscriptions from the webhook detail page.

- `translated_file.completed` fires when a translated file is completed and ready to download.
- `translated_file.edited` fires when a translated file is manually edited by a user in the translation editor.
- `translation_job.completed` fires when a translation job completes.

## Payload format

Every webhook delivery is an HTTP POST with a JSON body:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_xxx",
  "type": "translated_file.completed",
  "created_at": "2026-04-30T12:00:00.000Z",
  "api_version": "2026-03-06.v1",
  "data": {
    "object": {
      "id": "file_xxx",
      "org_id": "org_xxx",
      "project_id": "project_xxx",
      "branch_id": "branch_xxx",
      "source_file_id": "src_xxx",
      "file_id": "file_xxx",
      "version_id": "ver_xxx",
      "locale": "fr",
      "file_format": "json",
      "data_format": null,
      "completed_at": "2026-04-30T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

The top-level `id` is a stable event identifier you can use to deduplicate deliveries.

## Verify signatures

Every webhook request includes three headers:

- `webhook-id` is the event ID, such as `evt_xxx`.
- `webhook-timestamp` is the Unix timestamp, in seconds, when the request was sent.
- `webhook-signature` is the `v1,<base64-hmac>` signature.

The signature follows the [Standard Webhooks](https://www.standardwebhooks.com/) convention.

To verify a request:

1. Concatenate `{webhook-id}.{webhook-timestamp}.{raw request body}`.
2. Compute HMAC-SHA256 using your signing secret.
3. Base64-decode the secret after removing the `whsec_` prefix.
4. Base64-encode the result.
5. Compare it against the signature value after the `v1,` prefix.
6. Check that the timestamp is within 5 minutes of the current time to prevent replay attacks.

### Example: Node.js

```js
import crypto from "crypto";

function verifyWebhook(payload, headers, secret) {
  const msgId = headers["webhook-id"];
  const timestamp = headers["webhook-timestamp"];
  const signature = headers["webhook-signature"];

  const now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
  if (Math.abs(now - parseInt(timestamp)) > 300) {
    throw new Error("Timestamp too old");
  }

  const signingKey = Buffer.from(secret.replace("whsec_", ""), "base64");
  const signedContent = `${msgId}.${timestamp}.${payload}`;
  const expected = crypto
    .createHmac("sha256", signingKey)
    .update(signedContent)
    .digest("base64");

  const received = signature.split(",")[1];
  if (!crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(expected), Buffer.from(received))) {
    throw new Error("Invalid signature");
  }

  return JSON.parse(payload);
}
```

You can also use the [Standard Webhooks](https://www.standardwebhooks.com/) library for your language, which handles verification automatically.

## Handle retries and delivery

Webhooks use **at-least-once delivery**. 

If your endpoint does not return a `2xx` response within 10 seconds, the delivery is retried with exponential backoff for up to **10 attempts**.

You can manually retry a failed delivery from the webhook detail page in the Dashboard.

## Handle duplicate events

Because delivery is at least once, your endpoint may receive the same event more than once. Use the `id` field in the payload to deduplicate.

```js
app.post("/webhooks/gt", (req, res) => {
  const eventId = req.body.id;

  if (alreadyProcessed(eventId)) {
    return res.status(200).send("OK");
  }

  // Process the event...
  markProcessed(eventId);
  res.status(200).send("OK");
});
```

## Manage endpoints

From the webhook page, you can:

- Enable or disable an endpoint without deleting it
- Update the subscribed event types
- View delivery history
- Inspect individual delivery attempts
- Retry a failed delivery
- Reveal the signing secret
- Delete the endpoint

## Best practices

- Respond quickly with a `2xx` response, then process the event asynchronously.
- Verify the `webhook-signature` header before trusting the payload.
- Store processed event IDs and skip duplicates.
- Use HTTPS for production webhook endpoints.
- Monitor delivery history for persistent failures.

## Permissions

Managing webhook endpoints requires the `org:webhooks:write` permission.

Viewing delivery history requires `org:webhooks:read`.

By default, the **Admin** role has both permissions. See [roles and permissions](/docs/platform/dashboard/reference/roles-and-permissions) for details.
