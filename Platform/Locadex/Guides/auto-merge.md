# Auto-merge Locadex PRs

Auto-merge eliminates manual PR review for Locadex-generated pull requests. When enabled, PRs created by Locadex merge automatically after checks pass.

Auto-merge is available on each workflow configuration page, including Codegen, Translation, and Locales. 

## Set up auto-merge

Open **Locadex > Configuration**. Choose the workflow you want to configure:

- **Codegen** for code internationalization. Automatically wrap source code with internationalization library calls such as `t()` or the `T` component.
- **Translation** for content updates. Automatically translate new or updated source content into target languages.
- **Locales** for locale updates. Automatically update files in your project if languages are added or removed.

Read more about workflows at [Configure Workflows](/docs/platform/locadex/guides/configure-workflows).

For Mintlify projects, auto-merge is enabled by default.

## Configure GitHub permissions

If your default branch has protection rules, Locadex will continue creating PRs but cannot merge them automatically. Configure GitHub to allow Locadex to bypass branch protection:

1. **Open repository rulesets**: in your GitHub repository settings, select "Rulesets" from the Rules section.
2. **Identify blocking rules**: find rules preventing automatic merges. Multiple rules may need updating. Common blockers include: **"require a pull request before merging,"** required status checks, and required review approvals.
3. **Add bypass permissions**: select the rule blocking auto-merge, then **"Add Bypass"** and select "Locadex Agent" from the dropdown.
4. **Save changes**: make sure to click "Save" at the bottom of the page to apply your changes (this step is easy to miss!)



## Preserve manual edits

Turn on **Save local edits** if manual translation edits should be preserved before Locadex runs.

This is useful when your team reviews or edits generated translations in the Dashboard.

## Add validation commands

If Locadex should run a build, lint, or test command before creating the pull request, add a **post-process command**. (Pre-process commands run before Locadex processes files, post-process commands run after Locadex processes files).

For example:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Commands run from the repository root. For monorepos, set **App Root Directory** in General settings so Locadex knows where the app lives.

## When not to use auto-merge

Keep auto-merge off when:

- You want every Locadex pull request reviewed by a person.
- Generated changes need product or legal review.
- Your repository does not have reliable required checks.
- You are still testing Locadex setup.

Note: auto-merge does not apply to PRs for Setup or Re-run Setup.
