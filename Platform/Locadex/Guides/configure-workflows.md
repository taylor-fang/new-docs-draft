# Configure Locadex workflows

Use workflow settings to control what Locadex changes, when it runs, and how it opens pull requests.

Locadex has three workflows: **Codegen**, **Translation**, and **Update Locales**. Each can run on every pull request, on every commit, or manually.

## Choose your workflow

In your Dashboard Project sidebar, open **Locadex > Configuration**. You can configure three Locadex workflows for each Project:

- **Codegen** for code internationalization. 
  - Set when Locadex should wrap your source code with internationalization library calls such as `t()` or the `T` component.
- **Translation** for content updates. 
  - Set when Locadex should translate new or updated source content into target languages.
- **Locales** for locale updates. 
  - Set when Locadex should update files in your Project, if languages are added or removed. Use this workflow when changing source or target languages from the Agent page.

## Configure your workflow

### Edit trigger

Each workflow can run on one of three triggers:

- **On pull request** runs when relevant pull requests are opened or updated.
- **On commit** runs when commits are pushed to the monitored branch.
- **Manual only** runs only when you manually run the agent.

The default triggers for each workflow are: "On pull request" for Codegen, "On commit" for Translation, and "Manual only" for Locales.

### Edit target branch and prefix

Set **Target Branch** to the branch Locadex should monitor for changes. Most Projects use `main`.

Set **Branch Prefix** for branches created by Locadex. The default prefix is usually:

```txt
locadex/
```

Use a stable prefix so Locadex branches are easy to find in GitHub.

### Edit PR settings

Use the toggle buttons to control how Locadex creates and manages pull requests:

- **Auto-merge PRs** merges Locadex pull requests automatically when checks pass. See more information at [Auto-merge Locadex PRs.](/docs/platform/locadex/guides/auto-merge)
- **Run on exact content changes** narrows Locadex’s relevance check for the Codegen workflow. When enabled, Locadex checks only the changed lines in the diff. When disabled, it may check the full modified file. This setting does not affect the Translation or Locales workflows.
- **Save local edits** preserves manual translation edits before Locadex runs.

The text boxes at the bottom of the page provide additional customizability:

- **Custom PR Title** sets the title used for Locadex pull requests.
- **Custom Commit Message** sets the commit message used by Locadex.

### Add commands

Use commands to run steps such as setup or validation on your Project. Use commands to install dependencies, build your Project, lint generated changes, or run Project-specific checks. Commands can be run before or after Locadex processes files:

- **Pre-process command** runs before Locadex processes files. For example, run `npm run build`.
- **Post-process command** runs after Locadex processes files. For example, run `npm run typecheck` .

Commands run from the repository root and inside the [Locadex VM image](/docs/platform/locadex/reference/vm-image). If a workflow fails because a package, script, or binary is missing, add a pre-process command.

If any checks fail, [auto-merge](/docs/platform/locadex/guides/auto-merge) will not run.
