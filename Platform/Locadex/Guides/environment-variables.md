description: Add key-value environment variables that Locadex injects into the sandbox when workflows run.

# Add environment variables

Use environment variables for API keys, tokens, build configuration, or commands that run before or after Locadex processes files.

Environment variables are injected into the sandbox when Locadex runs workflows.

## Add a variable

In your Project sidebar, open **Locadex > Configuration > Secrets**. Click **Add Variable**.

Enter:

- **Key**, the environment variable name.
- **Value**, the secret or configuration value.

Then click **Save**.

## Edit a variable

Update the key or value, then click **Save**. Use the visibility control to show or hide a value while editing.

## Delete a variable

Click the delete icon next to the variable, then save the change.

## Common uses

Use environment variables for:

- API keys used by build or documentation tools.
- GitHub or package registry tokens.
- Feature flags required during build.
- Pre-process or post-process command configuration.

Environment variables are injected into the [Locadex runtime](/docs/platform/locadex/reference/vm-image) when workflows run. They are encrypted at rest and can only be accessed by the Locadex runtime.
