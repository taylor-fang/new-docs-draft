# Use Locadex in a monorepo

If your Project uses a monorepo, tell Locadex which folder contains the app you want to localize. You can set this app directory in the Locadex settings on the Dashboard.

## Set the app root directory

Use the app root directory when your GitHub repository contains multiple apps or packages. Configure at Locadex setup or in Settings. Open **Locadex > Configuration > General**.

Set **App Root Directory** to the path from the repository root to your app. Use `.` or leave the field empty only when the app is at the repository root.

## Configure commands

Workflow commands run from the repository root.

If a command needs to run inside the app directory, include the directory change in the command or use your package manager workspace command.

For example:

```bash
cd locadex-lab && npm run build
```
